# Performance Analysis of Probabilistic Classifiers

Performance analysis is a critical step in the training of machine learning models. Efficient performance analysis helps interpret classifiers, uncover reasons behind incorrect classifications, and assess of the reliability of predictions. Aggregrate metrics such as accuracy and precision obscure information about prediction probabilities and input values.

This web application addresses common classification practices and performance analysese of probabilistic classifiers.  Analytical tasks that the application supported include:
1. Examining overall performance of classifier
2. Examining class-level performance of classifier through visualizing the distribution of false positives (FP), true positives (TP), false negatives (FN), and true negatives TN in each class.
3. Examining instance-level performance
4. Identify between-class confusion
5. Identify examples of interest such as FN with high confidence scores since these examples can be more easily shifted to the correct class. 
6. Identify more severe errors such as FP with high confidence scores or FN with low confidence scores. 
7. Compare feature values for subsets of the dataset
